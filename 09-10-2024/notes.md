schematic design
    input are on the left side of schematic
    
    output are on the right side of schematic

    gate should flow from left to right or top to bottom

    straight wires are better to use than wires with multiple corners

    wires always connect at T junction

    a dot where wire cross indicates a connection between wires; otherwise they do not connect

sop schematic design step
    sop diagram can be systematically drawn following PLA method


example draw the logic function Y = A'B'C' + AB'C' + AB'C
    draw the term in column A, A', B, B', C, C'

    then draw it by terms


multiple output circuits
    4-input priority circuit
        the circuit has 4 output that signal which iinput should be given the priority when more than 1 input are requesting it.
